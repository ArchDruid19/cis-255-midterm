            <div class="about-me-container">
                <p>I was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, a small city in the German Empire (modern day
                    Germany). By age 13 I was already extremely passionate about mathematics,
                    teaching myself algebra, calculus, and Euclidean geometry. What fascinated me were puzzles of
                    nature: light,
                    magnetism, and the invisible forces that seemed to govern the world.
                    <br>
                    After studying at the Polytechnic in Zurich, I found myself working as a technical expert in the
                    Swiss Patent Office. It was there, in the quiet hours after work, that I developed many of the ideas
                    that would later be called revolutionary. In 1905, I published papers on the
                    photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, and the special theory of relativity which eventually
                    reshaped our
                    understanding of space and time.
                    <br>
                    Later, in 1915, I completed the general theory of relativity, which revealed gravity not as a force
                    but as the curvature of spacetime.
                    <br>
                    Beyond science, I have always cared deeply about humanity. I opposed war, nationalism, and injustice
                    wherever I saw them. Though I never considered myself a man of politics, I could not remain silent
                    when conscience demanded speech.
                    <br>
                    In my later years, I settled in Princeton, where I continued to think, to teach, and to wonder.

                            Throughout my life I have always been a pacifist. Prior to WWI, In 1914 I signed
                            a counter manifesto that called for an end to hostilites and a United Europe. I was also
                            part of the
                            German League of Human Rights, and was very dedicated to repairng relations between Germany
                            and France
                            after the war.
                            <br>
                            After moving to America in 1932 I became involved with the civil rights movement, where I
                            worked with a number of
                            organizations (such as the Princeton chapter of the NAACP) to demand equality and renouce
                            racist ideas.

                            One of my greatest joys has always been the act of learning. I have
                            devoted myself to understanding the mysteries of the world and, whenever possible, sharing
                            that understanding with others. From a very young age, I sensed that education was not
                            merely a path to a profession, but a lifelong endeavor that nourishes the mind and spirit.
                            To learn is to exercise curiosity, to question what others take for granted, and to find
                            beauty in the order hidden beneath apparent chaos. Teaching, in turn, has always been a
                            natural extension of this pursuit, for knowledge finds its true value only when it
                            enlightens others.

                            Music has always been very important to me. Since the age of six I have been playing the
                            violin.
                            Whenever I would travel I would bring my violin with me (which I named Lina) just in case
                            there would be a
                            chance I could play. At one point I was quoted as saying that "â€œIf I were not a physicist, I
                            would probably be a musician."
                            Whenever I am having trouble with my work in physics, I take a break and listen to Mozart or
                            Bach which helps me decompress
                            and think about solutions to problems more clearly.
